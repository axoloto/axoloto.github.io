# My personal blog

Personal blog where I present some of my personal projects and experiments. You probably want to read it on https://axoloto.github.io.

It is powered by [Hydejack](https://qwtel.com/hydejack/), big kudos to him for providing such a nice framework!

Instructions directly taken from [his documentation](https://hydejack.com/docs/install/) to run the website locally:

Make sure youâ€™ve `cd` ed into the directory where `_config.yml` is located. Before running for the first time, dependencies need to be fetched from RubyGems:

~~~
$ bundle install
~~~

If you are missing the bundle command, you can install Bundler by running gem install bundler.

Now you can run Jekyll on your local machine:

~~~
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
~~~

and point your browser to http://localhost:4000 to see it in action.
