## Introduction

Last year, I posted a deep technical blog post (link) about periodic boundary conditions within a Position Based Dynamics (PBD) framework. It was part of my work implementing a PBD clouds model based on this paper(links). I then promised that my next post would be about this, but it didn't happen. In 2024, my professional life has been hectic, and diving back into the complexity of clouds physics requires too much time. Also, I'm not super happy with the results. I got some nice realtime dynamics but the visuals are lacking. I need to implement a volume renderer to properly highlight the simulation.

So let's focus on something else that has been a growing pain with my RealTimeParticles application: Everytime a model is added, a lot of UI/engine connections must be effectuated manually, and complexity is growing in an unsubstainable way. 

**How can I connect the UI to my various physical models in a simpler and generic way?**

As you have probably guessed from the title of this blog post, the answer is JSON, a powerful data interchange format coming from Web development that can help us tremendously in software development.

Regarding the structure of this blog post, I will first present the current problematic state of my connection UI/engine, then we will see JSON basics and finally how I can use it in my situation to reduce the boilerplate for my next model implementation. No fancy theory here, and no specific knowledge requested aside from a classic computer science background. Let's get right into it!

## An unsubstainable UI/engine interface

-Picture of the app / RealTimeParticles 1.0 with main widget (top-left), graphics widget (bottom-left) and physics widget (right) for clouds model.

For those who have played a bit with my RealTimeParticles (RTP) application, it probably seems obvious that UI/UX is not very high in my list of priorities. I only implemented the bare minimum to play with the physical models and to adjust their rendering. Thus, the UI is very basic, it's only a couple of widgets on top of DearImgui (link). For every frame, these widgets obtain data from the physics and graphics engines through getters, render it, and update through setters any value modified by the users. 

-Diagram 1 notebook - UI/Widget interactions

The connection to the UI is very similar for the two engines. However it is very limited on the Graphics engine side as it doesn't necessitate many parameters, so let's focus on the physics engine side where we keep adding models. Here are some details of the implementation on UI and engine sides for the Clouds model:
~~~cpp
  ImGui::Spacing();
  ImGui::Text("Clouds Parameters");
  ImGui::Spacing();

  bool isTempSmoothingEnabled = cloudsEngine->isTempSmoothingEnabled();
  if (ImGui::Checkbox("Enable Temperature Smoothing", &isTempSmoothingEnabled))
  {
    cloudsEngine->enableTempSmoothing(isTempSmoothingEnabled);
  }

  float groundHeatCoeff = cloudsEngine->getGroundHeatCoeff();
  if (ImGui::SliderFloat("Ground Heat Coefficient", &groundHeatCoeff, 0.0f, 1000.0f, "%.4f"))
  {
    cloudsEngine->setGroundHeatCoeff(groundHeatCoeff);
  }

  float buoyancyCoeff = cloudsEngine->getBuoyancyCoeff();
  if (ImGui::SliderFloat("Buoyancy Coefficient", &buoyancyCoeff, 0.0f, 5.0f, "%.4f"))
  {
    cloudsEngine->setBuoyancyCoeff(buoyancyCoeff);
  }

  float gravCoeff = cloudsEngine->getGravCoeff();
  if (ImGui::SliderFloat("Gravity Coefficient", &gravCoeff, 0.0f, 0.1f, "%.4f"))
  {
    cloudsEngine->setGravCoeff(gravCoeff);
  }
~~~
At the beginning of the clouds section in PhysicsWidget.cpp

~~~cpp
  void enableTempSmoothing(bool enable);
  bool isTempSmoothingEnabled() const;
  //
  void setGroundHeatCoeff(float coeff);
  float getGroundHeatCoeff() const;
  //
  void setBuoyancyCoeff(float coeff);
  float getBuoyancyCoeff() const;
  //
  void setGravCoeff(float coeff);
  float getGravCoeff() const;
~~~
Half of CloudsModel.hpp looks like this, not great

As I said, it's a very basic implementation, everything has to be declared/defined and connected manually. Also, you can note that the value range for each parameter is hardcoded in the UI. This is bad, it should be encapsulated in the definition of the physical model. Yet, I think that the famous approach Keeping It Stupid but Simple (link) is always a good start and this setup was totally fine at first. When there was only the boids model, it only required a couple of getter/setters and limited boilerplate on widget side, totally fine. Then, I added the fluids models with a lot more parameters to tweak and I had to add one or two hundred lines of additional boilerplate, a bit more annoying but still manageable. However, the recent clouds model with 19 additional parameters made it clear that this simplistic approach was not substainable. With the three models, the physics widget with all their parameters is now 500 lines long and the header file of my clouds model has more than 100 lines of getters and setters. Before adding any other model to the mix, something has to be done to simplify the junction between PhysicsWidget and the physical models.

Hmm... it would be nice if I could have some generic datastructure storing all my model params despite their different types, no matter the model, and then UI would loop through this datastructure, display the values and send back any modified ones to the engine. It is surely doable with a standard container and some template magic. Let's try to design this. First, let me just... Waaait! Folks, this is 2024 and almost everything already exists on the Internet, even open source and under MIT license if lucky. What about trying to reuse someone's else magic instead of reinventing the wheel? There enters JSON!

## JSON and the golden fleece
### What's JSON?
JSON aka JavaScript Object Notation is a very popular data-interchange format that was initially implemented in JavaScript 25 years ago. It has since spread to dozens of different programming languages, being widely praised for its simplicity to read as a human and parse as a machine. Data-interchange concept refers to the process of exchanging data between different systems so that information sent by one system can be understood and used by another, even if those systems are built using different technologies, languages or platforms. In our case, the data-interchange process is relatively straightforward, the physics engine sends the names and values of its models parameters to the UI layer and in return receives values modified by the user.

### How do you represent something in JSON?
A JSON object is an ordered list of key-value pairs where values can be strings, numbers, booleans, null values, arrays and also... JSON objects! This makes it versatile and ideal for representing complex data structures. Also, JSON objects can be serialized in a JSON file. In our UI/engine case, we won't need to serialize/deserialize anything, as the two systems exchanging data are in the same C++ program so we can keep everything in the program memory. We could use serialization to save custom models parameters values in a JSON file and share it with other RealTimeParticles users for example. I won't dive too much into JSON syntax because hundreds of websites already do it really well like the [official JSON page](https://www.json.org/json-en.html), but here is an example:

~~~json
{
  "name": "Santa Claus",      // string
  "age": null,                // null value, Santa's exact age is unknown or timeless
  "address": "North Pole", // string
  "has_chimney_entry_skills": true, // bool
  "sleigh": {                   // Another JSON object
    "mileage": 34000,
    "weight": 344,
    "plate_number": null
  }
}
~~~

### JSON in C++

There is no built-in support for JSON in C++. The language was invented before the format, and the latter hasn't made yet its way to the standard library. Nevertheless, many open-source third party libraries brings JSON support to C++. Personally, I really like `nohlmann::json` for its convenience and accessibility. Heavily templated, it only requires a couple of headers through a single `#include<nlohmann/json.hpp>`. It also provides a lot of features for an nice integration in C++: implicit conversions, arbitrary type conversions, JSON Merge Patch, STL-container support, type checkers... Another nicety is its availability through the third-party package manager Conan already used in the RealTimeParticles application. With Conan, we can obtain the latest version of  `nlohmann::json` header library and plug it into the application very easily.

~~~cpp
using json = nlohmann::json;

namespace ns {
    // a simple struct to model a person
    struct person {
        std::string name;
        std::string address;
        bool has_chimney_entry_skills;
    };
    // operator to convert a person object to a JSON object
    void to_json(json& j, const person& p) {
        j = json{ {"name", p.name}, {"address", p.address}, {"hasChimneyEntrySkills", p.has_chimney_entry_skills}};
    }
    // operator to convert a JSON object to a person object
    void from_json(const json& j, person& p) {
        j.at("name").get_to(p.name);
        j.at("address").get_to(p.address);
        j.at("hasChimneyEntrySkills").get_to(p.has_chimney_entry_skills);
    }
}

// create a person
ns::person p {"Santa Claus", "North Pole", true};

// conversion: person -> json
json j = p;

// list is ordered and will be printed accordingly
std::cout << j << std::endl;
// {"address":"North Pole", "hasChimneyEntrySkills":true,"name":"Santa Claus"}

// conversion: json -> person
auto p2 = j.template get<ns::person>();

// that's it
assert(p == p2);

## Implementing a JSON interface in RealTimeParticles

### What's the plan?

Alright, now that we have presented our current UI/engine issue and quickly introduced JSON, let's see how we can leverage it in this situation which is getting out of hands. In order to aim toward this ideal of a generic and automatic interface between UI and physics engine, **the focus is to get rid of all the parameters' getters/setters boilerplate on the engine side and to automate the generation of the physics widget on the UI side.** Doing so, adding a new physics parameter or model will be straightforward. Also, keep in mind that the data transfer must go either way as we need to update within the engine the physics parameters values modified by the user.

To achieve this, the proposal is to store all physics parameters data of a given physical model into a JSON object owned by the model. The engine will then pass this generic JSON object to the physics UI widget which will unparse it and draw UI items for each key-value pair of the JSON. At the end of the frame, if the user has modified some values, we can then simply pass the updated JSON back to the engine which will unparse it and update the model. The data transfer round-trip is complete.

/graph JSON flow

### Storing inputs through JSON on engine side

In order to store all our physics data into a JSON object, we need to do quite a bit of refactoring into the physics engine. All parameters data defining a model now goes into the JSON object `m_inputJson` owned by the base class `Model`. The OpenCL implementation of this base class is called `oclModel`, and the different existing models `Boids/Fluids/Clouds` are implemented on top of it. During the refactoring, I initially focus on the fluids model and deactivate the other ones to iterate faster.

~~~cpp
// Fluids.cpp

// Initial state of the fluids model parameters
static const json initFluidsJson // clang-format off
{ 
  {"Fluids", {
      { "Rest Density", { 450.0f, 10.0f, 1000.0f } },
      { "Relax CFM", { 600.0f, 100.0f, 1000.0f } },
      { "Time Step", { 0.010f, 0.0001f, 0.020f } },
      { "Nb Jacobi Iterations", { 2, 1, 6 } },
      { "Artificial Pressure",
          { { "Enable##Pressure", true },
            { "Coefficient##Pressure", { 0.001f, 0.0f, 0.001f} },
            { "Radius", {0.006f, 0.001f, 0.015f}},
            { "Exp", {4, 1, 6}}
          }
      },
      { "Vorticity Confinement",
          { { "Enable##Vorticity", true },
            { "Coefficient##Vorticity", {0.0004f, 0.0f, 0.001f}},
            { "xSPH Viscosity Coefficient", {0.0001f, 0.0f, 0.001f}}
          }
      }
    }
  }
}; // clang-format on

Fluids::Fluids(ModelParams params)
    : OclModel<FluidKernelInputs>(params, FluidKernelInputs {}, json(initFluidsJson)) // Initialize Fluids with initFluidsJson
    //...
~~~
All fluids model parameters are stored in a JSON object with their default values

As shown above, the fluids model parameters with their initial values are stored in a single JSON object `initFluidsJson`. For numerics values, we have the following layout: `name - {default val, min val, max val}`, using an array for the values. Compared to the original design, encapsulation is much better with the range value of each parameter stored in the model itself aside its current value, no more leaking at UI level. Also note the two sub-JSON objects `Artifical Pressure` and `Vorticity Confinement` used for conditional parameters that can enable other parameters if active.

~~~cpp
// Model.hpp

public:
Model(ModelParams params, json js = {})

json getInputJson() const
{
  return m_inputJson;
}

void updateInputJson(const json& newJson)
{
  // No modification, no update
  if (json::diff(m_inputJson, newJson).empty())
    return;

  m_inputJson.merge_patch(newJson);
  updateModelWithInputJson(m_inputJson);
}

protected:
// Derived classes must implement their JSON parser
virtual void updateModelWithInputJson(json& inputJson) = 0;

private:
// Private to prevent derived classes to modify/use it outside updateModelWithInputJson()
// Once parsed, for safeness, derived classes must only rely on their member vars
// Not perfect (extra copy and memory) but safe
json m_inputJson;
~~~
JSON input integration in the physics engine at `Model` level

The implementation at `Model` level ends up being quite straightforward. The JSON input is logically passed as a constructor parameter. Instead of having dozens of getters for each parameter, we have now greatly reduced in granularity with a single `getInputJson()` API. `updateInputJson()` is the setter to update the model JSON, inside it we use the JSON Merge Patch feature to update modified parameter values of the model. Also, note the abstract function `updateModelWithInputJson()` that must be defined for each model type, this is where the model parses `m_inputJson` to obtain its different parameters values. Finally, we can notice that `m_inputJson` is private and therefore not accessible to the leaf models classes. This design choice favors safeness over performance, it allows us to clearly define where parsing happens as it can be a risky operation. We will come back to it later (link cons).

### Parsing JSON input to automatically generate UI

#### High-level data transfer in `PhysicsWidget`
We already presented the two APIs `getInputJson()/updateInputJson()` from the physics engine that allow the data round-trip. We can now call them in the physics UI widget to retrieve the JSON object and send it back to the engine.

~~~cpp
// PhysicsWidget.cpp

void UI::PhysicsWidget::display()
{
  auto physicsEngine = m_physicsEngine.lock();

  //...

  // Retrieve input json from the physics engine with all available parameters
  json js = physicsEngine->getInputJson();
  // Draw all items from input json
  drawImguiObjectFromJson(js);
  // Update physics engine with new parameters values if any
  physicsEngine->updateInputJson(js);
}
~~~
New generic JSON workflow between PhysicsWidget and the physics engine

Notice the generic aspect of the new workflow, the physics widget doesn't know anymore which model is used, it just retrieves a JSON object, draw it, update it and send it back. We don't even include the different models headers anymore, only the base `Model.hpp`. Previously, we used to call the parameters getters  from the leaf model type, as the parameters depend on the model itself. To do so, we had to cast dynamically the physics engine with the different leaf model types and add model-specific logic to handle it, all of this is gone, the UI logic is much more generic.

#### JSON drawer loop
~~~cpp
// PhysicsWidget.cpp

void drawImguiObjectFromJson(json& js)
{
  for (auto& pair : js.items())
  {
    const auto& name = pair.key();
    auto& val = pair.value();

    if (val.is_object())
    {
      ImGui::Spacing();
      ImGui::Text(name.c_str());
      ImGui::Indent(15.0f);
      // Recursive call
      drawImguiObjectFromJson(val);
      ImGui::Unindent(15.0f);
      ImGui::Spacing();
    }
    else if (val.is_boolean())
    {
      // accessing json bool value by reference, directly modifying the value within the json
      drawImguiCheckBoxFromJson(name, val.get_ref<bool&>());

      // special case where we skip the rest of the items if "Enable" param is false
      bool skipRestOfItems = name.find("Enable##") != std::string::npos && val == false;

      if (skipRestOfItems)
        return;
    }
    else if (val.is_array() && val.size() == 3)
    {
      if (val[0].is_number_integer())
      {
        // cannot directly access json array items by reference, one copy needed
        drawImguiSliderInt(name, val);
      }
      else if (val[0].is_number_float())
      {
        // cannot directly access json array items by reference, one copy needed
        drawImguiSliderFloat(name, val);
      }
    }
    else
    {
      LOG_ERROR("{} type is not supported by PhysicsWidget drawer", name);
    }
  }
}
~~~
Drawer looping on all items of the JSON model input

The function `drawImguiObjectFromJson()` handles the drawing of the whole JSON object, it loops through the different pair of key-value and act on them. If the value is another JSON object, it recursively calls itself with the sub-object. For the other supported types: `float/int/bool`, it calls helper functions on top of DearImgui to draw the UI items. The list of supported types is hardcoded and limited, it could probably be improved but the DearImgui APIs are hard typed anyway and we are able to implement the three existing models with this set of types. 

You can notice the hardcoded logic with `skipRestOfItems` for boolean parameters. This is a limited hack allowing us to generate conditional sub-blocks of parameters in our UI, if feature A is disabled, there is no need to draw all its sub parameters to tweak it. It only works it we implement feature with sub-parameters as JSON sub-objects in our JSON model input (see above inputFluidsJson link).

#### Drawing boolean checkbox
For boolean parameters, we pass directly the reference of the JSON value to `drawImguiCheckBoxFromJson()` using `val.get_ref<bool&>()`, this is safe as we ensure `val.is_boolean()` before doing so. It allows us to let the user modifying the value in place within the JSON object, which is pretty nice.

~~~cpp
// PhysicsWidget.cpp

void drawImguiCheckBoxFromJson(const std::string& name, bool& enable)
{
  ImGui::Checkbox(name.c_str(), &enable);
}
~~~
`drawImguiCheckBoxFromJson()` is just a wrapper around ImGui API

#### Drawing numerical sliders
For numerical parameters, we store arrays instead of single values in order to pass the min/max range with the current value of the parameter. This allows us to keep everything encapsulated and close together in the model, but prevents us from obtaining direct references to the value. Indeed, currently `nlohmann::json` doesn't support direct access by reference for array items. Nevermind, we can do a copy of the array.

~~~cpp
// PhysicsWidget.cpp

void drawImguiSliderFloat(const std::string& name, json& js)
{
  float floatVal = js.at(0);
  float minVal = js.at(1);
  float maxVal = js.at(2);
  std::string precision = floatVal <= 0.1f ? "%.4f" : "%.2f";
  if (ImGui::SliderFloat(name.c_str(), &floatVal, minVal, maxVal, precision.c_str()))
  {
    js.at(0) = floatVal;
  }
}
~~~
Precision varies based on the value.

### Parsing JSON input to update model and GPU kernels

#### Adding an intermediary `OpenCLModel` layer
I have described how the models parameters are sent to the UI layer and rendered there. As already mentioned, they came back on the simulation side with updated values through `physicsEngine->updateInputJson(js);`(link). Now, I need to implement `updateModelWithInputJson(json& inputJson)` to define how the model parses the JSON object to update its parameters values. In our OpenCL-based physics engine based, it mostly resumes in passing the information to the GPU kernels that runs the simulation. So I choose to implement an intermediary class `OclModel` between `Model` and `Boids/Fluids/Clouds` defining this in a clean and generic way through two new functions `transferJsonInputsToModel(json& inputJson)` and `transferKernelInputsToGPU()`:

~~~cpp
// OclModel.hpp

// OclModel is a variadic template inheriting from Model
// KernelInputs are structs used to pass model parameters values as args to GPU kernels
// Fluids model uses a single kernel input struct
// Clouds has two kernel input structs as it uses most of the fluids kernels and some clouds-specific ones 
template <typename... KernelInputs>
class OclModel : public Model
{
  public:
  OclModel(ModelParams params, KernelInputs... kernelInputs, json inputJson = {})
      : Model(params, inputJson)
  {
    // Adding all inputs to kernel inputs for GPU-CPU interaction
    (m_kernelInputs.push_back(kernelInputs), ...);
  };

  //...

  // This override is called within Model::updateInputJson(const json& newJson)
  void updateModelWithInputJson(json& inputJson) override
  {
    // First transfer inputs from json to model and kernel inputs
    transferJsonInputsToModel(inputJson);
    // Then transfer kernel inputs from CPU to GPU
    transferKernelInputsToGPU();
  }

  // Model-specific logic, from json to model
  virtual void transferJsonInputsToModel(json& inputJson) = 0;
  // Model-specific logic, from model to gpu kernels
  virtual void transferKernelInputsToGPU() = 0;

  // KernelInputs logic...
}
~~~
A new intermediary class `OclModel.hpp` (simplified version)

#### Passing the parameters values to the GPU

Now, we just need to define `transferJsonInputsToModel(json& inputJson)/transferKernelInputsToGPU()` within our different models to complete our round-trip data transfer from UI to model with JSON.

~~~cpp
// Fluid.cpp

void Fluids::transferJsonInputsToModel(json& inputJson)
{
  if (!m_init)
    return;

  // Wrong parameter path will trigger an exception
  try
  {
    const auto& fluidsJson = inputJson["Fluids"];

    // Caching this parameter for easier use in the physics loop - not perfect
    m_nbJacobiIters = fluidsJson["Nb Jacobi Iterations"][0];

    auto& kernelInputs = getKernelInput<FluidKernelInputs>(0);
    // Updating the fluids kernel input struct
    kernelInputs.restDensity = (cl_float)(fluidsJson["Rest Density"][0]);
    kernelInputs.relaxCFM = (cl_float)(fluidsJson.at("Relax CFM")[0]);
    kernelInputs.timeStep = (cl_float)(fluidsJson["Time Step"][0]);
    kernelInputs.dim = (cl_uint)((m_dimension == Geometry::Dimension::dim2D) ? 2 : 3);
    //...
  }
  catch (...)
  {
    LOG_ERROR("Fluids Input Json parsing is incorrect, did you use a wrong path for a parameter?");

    throw std::runtime_error("Wrong Json parsing");
  }
};
~~~
Passing data to the model

Being the first one called, `transferJsonInputsToModel()` parses the incoming JSON object to update model internal data used in the simulation loop. A bit unrelated to current JSON topic, we now pass model parameters values to GPU kernels through `KernelInputs` structs. So `tranferJsonInputsToModel()` is mostly about filling these structs.

~~~cpp
// Fluids.cpp

void Fluids::transferKernelInputsToGPU()
{
  if (!m_init)
    return;

  assert(getNbKernelInputs() == 1);
  const auto& kernelInputs = getKernelInput<FluidKernelInputs>(0);

  CL::Context& clContext = CL::Context::Get();
  clContext.setKernelArg(KERNEL_PREDICT_POS, 2, sizeof(FluidKernelInputs), &kernelInputs);
  clContext.setKernelArg(KERNEL_UPDATE_VEL, 2, sizeof(FluidKernelInputs), &kernelInputs);
  //...
}
~~~
Passing data to the GPU

Once the kernel input struct is updated, in `transferKernelInputsToGPU()` we set it as an argument to the different GPU kernels that needs it. And voila, round-trip data transfer between UI and model with JSONs is complete!

## Results

Now that the system is up and running, let's do a quick comparison between the pros and the cons of our new JSON approach. I was aware of most of its advantages as they are the reasons I started this project. Some inconvenients also appeared along the way but that was expected, nothing is perfect in life, especially not my initial JSON proposal nor my implementation. So let's take a step back and see what survives the reality test.

### Pros

#### Less boilerplate code
Having less boilerplate to do the plumbing in both UI and engine side was the main reason I went into this project. Regarding this, it has been a real success. I have been able to remove about 100 lines of code (LOC) in the different models header files, about 350 LOC in the models implementations and 500 LOC in `PhysicsWidget`, about 1000 LOC gone!

#### Generic and automated UI
Most of the UI for the physics engine is now automated, this is another great improvment. I don't have to spend time adjusting the different parameters widgets, how they interact or even their layout. Everything is automatic. I can now solely focus on the core drawer loop (link) and a single change will impact any parameter of any model.

#### Separation of concern and encapsulation
With the new approach, UI does UI and physics does... physics. UI doesn't know anymore anything about the physical models. It just receives a JSON object, displays it and updates it if needed. On the other end, the physics engine now contains in a single data structure all the parameters provided to the users with their range and default values. Definitely much better than hardcoding parameter range within the UI layer.

#### Next model can be added in an instant
This is the biggest win for me, thanks to all the points mentioned above, I can now add a new model and connect it to the existing UI in a few minutes. This is perfect for prototyping and focusing on what matters to me: implementing physics simulations!

### Cons

#### Automatic UI means less customization
Nothing surprising here, this was expected. If you automatize a system, you accept loosing tweaks in favor of uniformity. Nevertheless, it became an small issue with some bool parameters enabling sub-systems, previously I was just hiding those sub-systems parameters if the upper condition was disabled. With the automatic UI generation, I had to implement some extra logic and find a proper JSON layout to maintain the UX and ensure no regression on UI side. It was acceptable for me to add small adjustments to cover these corner cases, but it might become tricky if I have more constraints.

#### No explicit type means more risks
One important inconvenient is the absence of explicit typing for the parameters within the JSON input. It comes inherently with JSON generic storage. Because of this, within the model implementation I need to be careful when parsing the information from the JSON object: the absence of the parameter, its wrong path or a non-matching type might generate bad surprises. For now, to counter this I prefer to use the JSON input mostly for the transfer, and to store the models data in its member variables once transmitted. It adds a bit of overhead but creates a clear data transfer cascade from JSON input to kernel inputs. With `KernelInputs`, I have to do a copy anyway in order to pass the data to the GPU. 

So the JSON input is parsed once per update in `transferJsonInputsToModel(json& inputJson)` and then kept away from the physics processing loop. This approach is not optimal as it generates an extra copy and means duplicated data. At the scale of the current system, I am totally fine with the trade-off as it comes with a lot of advantages. But for a bigger system, I would probably implement a safety layer to make it more robust, using type checking and default values if a parameter is not found at runtime. Doing so would allow me to store the data only in the JSON and keep a single source of truth. Again, no deal breaker here, only some inconvenients to be aware of but I consider the tradeoff to be completely worthy in my situation. 

## Conclusion

We reach the end of this post which presented one way to use JSON to connect your UI to your C++ engine. I hope you liked it. Personally, I am very happy with the changes and I can't wait to implement the next model and see how much time is won with the new system. As any approach, it comes with pros and cons, but I think the pros largely outweights the cons in my case. I encourage to have a look at JSON and see if you can use it in your project! Happy coding!
